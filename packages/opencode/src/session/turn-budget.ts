// Item 24: shared per-TURN budget pool. ONE pool is created per prompt turn
// (SessionPrompt.prompt) and shared by the main loop (chargeDirect on each
// step-finish) and EVERY workflow run the turn starts (reserve/settle around
// each ctx.agent step) — so two runs of the same turn compete for the same
// USD headroom instead of each getting its own cap.
//
// The pool is turn-scoped and IN-MEMORY by design: it binds to exactly one
// prompt turn, and plain object-reference sharing carries it everywhere it
// needs to go (a background run keeps holding the reference past the turn's
// end; the main loop simply stops charging once the turn finished). It is
// deliberately NOT persisted (InstanceState/DB) — a resume turn brings its own
// fresh pool.
//
// ATOMICITY: `reserve` is a synchronous check-and-set with no await in
// between. Bun is single-threaded, so no other fiber can interleave between
// the headroom check and the reservation — this closes the audited soft-cap
// race of the per-run budget gate (N parallel steps could all pass a
// check-only gate before any of them charged). The known residual: with
// `avgStepUsd === 0` (no settled step yet) reservations are free, so the
// FIRST parallel wave can still overspend bounded by its in-flight cost —
// exactly the per-run soft cap's documented bound.
//
// The `tokens` limit is structurally prepared (Item 17 supplies the token
// telemetry) but the reservation itself is USD-denominated; a tokens-only
// pool gates on committed tokens at reserve time.
