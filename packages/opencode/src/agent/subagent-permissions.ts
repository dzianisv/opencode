/**
 * Build the `permission` ruleset for a subagent's session when it's spawned
 * via the task tool, the subtask (@agent) path, or a workflow agent dispatch.
 * This function is the SINGLE source of the task/todowrite/workflow
 * auto-denies (task.ts keeps only the `experimental.primary_tools` denies).
 * Combines:
 *
 * 1. The parent session's deny rules and external_directory rules.
 *    Parent agent restrictions only govern that agent; the subagent's own
 *    permissions determine its capabilities. Inherited denies are monotone
 *    ceilings: a deny on level ≤ n can never evaluate to allow on level n+1.
 * 2. A default `todowrite` deny if the subagent's own ruleset doesn't
 *    already permit it (unchanged by nesting).
 * 3. Depth gating (design-final §4.1, defense line 1): `task` AND `workflow`
 *    denies are added ONLY for a child at the maximum nesting depth
 *    (childDepth >= maxDepth) — the last level is a pure work level that
 *    never spawns, regardless of the agent's own config. Below the limit no
 *    auto-deny is emitted; spawn capability is governed by the agent's
 *    permission via the runtime merge (tools.ts / llm/request.ts), so the
 *    default wildcard `'*': allow` suffices and no exact `task` rule is
 *    required anymore. Because the auto-deny only ever lands on the
 *    never-spawning last level, it cannot be wrongly re-inherited down a
 *    spawning chain (the former sticky-deny problem).
