//      An explicitly supplied value always wins over the default. Either way the
//      value (supplied OR default) is run through the SAME coercion below, so a
//      `default: "7"` for a number-declared arg reaches run() as the number 7,
//      consistent with the authoritative type contract.
//   2. Coercion to the declared `type`:
//      - number: a numeric string ("42") becomes the number 42; the result must
//        be finite, so "abc"/"Infinity" and a non-string/non-number (null,

//        value as 0; we treat those as InvalidError instead. We deliberately keep
//        the full `Number()` parse semantics for the remaining strings, which
//        means hex ("0x10" -> 16) and exponent ("1e3" -> 1000) are accepted; for
//        JSON/HTTP-shaped numbers this is the least-surprising choice and stays
//        consistent with the rest of the numeric path. A value already a number
//        is kept as-is.
//      - boolean: only the strings "true"/"false" (or an actual boolean) are
//        accepted; anything else fails with InvalidError.
//      - string: a primitive non-string (number/boolean) is coerced via
//        String(...). A non-primitive (object/array) is left UNCHANGED — there is
//        no honest String() for it and forcing "[object Object]" would hide a
